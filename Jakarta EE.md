**JAKARTA EE:**

**I) DEFINITION:**

Jakarta EE is like a detailed guide for building big, complex applications in Java. Jakarta EE extends the Java SE (Standard Edition) platform,While Java SE (Standard Edition) gives you the basic tools to write Java programs.Jakarta EE adds extra features specifically for building large, business-oriented applications.These extra features help with things like handling web** requests, managing business rules, and interacting with databases.**

**II) FEATURES:**

**Integration: **Jakarta EE supports various integrations, such as web services (SOAP and REST).

**Security**: It includes built-in security mechanisms for authentication, authorization, and data protection.

**Scalability**: Jakarta EE is designed to handle large-scale, high-performance applications, making it suitable for enterprise environments.

**Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management of object creation and dependencies, promoting loose coupling and better testability.

**Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)**: A server-side component architecture for modular construction of enterprise applications. EJBs provide functionalities such as transaction management, security, and concurrency.

**III) COMPONENTS:**

**Servlets**: Used for handling HTTP requests and generating responses. They are the building blocks of web applications in Jakarta EE.

**JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: These are technologies for creating dynamic web content. JSP is used for generating HTML pages.

**Jakarta Security: **Provides security features for authentication, authorization, and data protection.

**Java Persistence API (JPA):** Manages database interactions and object-relational mapping (ORM), simplifying data access.

**Dependency Injection: **Simplifies the management of object creation and dependencies, promoting loose coupling and better testability.

**IV)USE:**

Jakarta EE is used for developing a wide range of enterprise applications, including:

**Web Applications**: Dynamic websites and web-based interfaces.

**Business Applications**: Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and other business-critical applications.

**Microservices**: With frameworks like Eclipse MicroProfile, Jakarta EE can be used to build and manage microservices architectures.

**V) CONCEPTS:**

**Enterprise Application Architecture: **Jakarta EE promotes a layered architecture, separating concerns into different layers such as presentation, business logic,

**Dependency Injection:** Manages object creation and dependencies, reducing boilerplate code

**Component-Based Development:** Encourages the development of reusable components, such as EJBs and JSF components, which can be assembled into larger applications.

**Transaction Management:** Provides support for managing transactions across multiple operations, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

**VI) PROBLEMS SOLVED BY JAKARTA EE:**

**Complexity Management: **Jakarta EE provides a structured approach to managing complex enterprise applications, making it easier to develop, deploy, and maintain them.

**Portability**: By adhering to standardized APIs, Jakarta EE ensures that applications can run on any compliant server.

**Security**: Built-in security features help protect applications from various threats, including unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Integration**: Jakarta EE simplifies the integration with other systems and technologies, facilitating communication and data exchange.

**Development Efficiency**: With features like dependency injection and pre-built components, Jakarta EE helps reduce development time and improve code quality.
