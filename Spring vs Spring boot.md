**12) SPRING VS SPRING BOOT:**

**SPRING: **



* The Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise level Java applications.
* Spring applications require extensive XML configurations which can be verbose and time-consuming to set up.
* It requires manual configuration.
* Spring applications require a web server (like Tomcat) to run, and configuration can be complex.
* Developers need to write boilerplate code for smaller tasks.
* To run the Spring application, a deployment descriptor is required.

**SPRING BOOT:**



* Spring Boot is a project built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of developing stand-alone, production ready applications in java.
* It has auto-configuration. 
* Embedded Servers: Spring Boot supports embedded servers (like Tomcat or Undertow), allowing applications to run as standalone JAR files without needing an external application server.
* In Spring Boot, there is reduction in boilerplate code.
* There is no requirement for a deployment descriptor.
