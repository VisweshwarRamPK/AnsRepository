**13) TOMCAT:**

**I) DEFINITION:**

Tomcat is a web server,It implements Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP).Websocket Technologies.It is used to develop and deploy java applications.

**II) FEATURES OF TOMCAT:**

**Servlet Container:** Tomcat provides the runtime environment for Java servlets. It manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles HTTP requests, and forwards responses.

**JSP Engine:** Tomcat has a JSP engine that translates JSP files into servlets, making it easier to develop dynamic web content.

**WebSocket Support:** It supports WebSocket protocol, enabling real-time communication between clients and servers.


### **III) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOMCAT AND OTHER JAVA EE SERVERS LIKE JBOSS,WEBLOGIC AND WEBSPHERE:**



    * Tomcat is primarily a Servlet and JSP container. It doesn’t implement the full Java EE (Jakarta EE) stack.
    * Servers like JBoss, WebLogic, and WebSphere are full Jakarta EE application servers that support additional features like EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans), JPA (Java Persistence API), and JMS (Java Message Service).
    * Tomcat is often used for lighter-weight applications where full enterprise-level support isn’t needed, whereas JBoss, WebLogic, and WebSphere are used for enterprise-scale applications that require more comprehensive Jakarta EE services.


### **IV) TOMCAT COMPONENTS:**



    * **STARTUP**: Tomcat starts up, loading configurations (like `server.xml` and `web.xml`), initializing connectors.
    * **COYOTE:** Tomcat uses a connector to listen for HTTP requests from clients,and forwards to catalina.
    * **CATALINA:** The Catalina servlet engine processes incoming requests, then maps them to the appropriate servlet based on the URL pattern.
    * For each request, Tomcat creates an HTTP request and response object, which are passed to the servlet for processing.
    * Once the servlet processes the request, it generates a response (usually HTML, JSON, XML, etc.), and Tomcat sends this response back to the client.

**V) TOMCAT CONFIGURATIONS:**

Tomcat can be configured using configuration files like `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and `context.xml` located in the `conf` directory.

**server.xml:** configures port numbers, connectors,hosts.

**web.xml:** Configures servlets, filters, and URL mappings,security features for each web application.

**context.xml:** database connection.

**VI) TOMCAT SESSION MANAGEMENT:**

Tomcat manages HTTP sessions by generating a unique Session ID for each client.

It uses either cookies or URL rewriting to maintain session state between the client and server.

**VII) TOMCAT SECURITY:**

**SSL/TLS: **Tomcat can be configured to use SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between the client and the server. This is done by configuring a connector in the `server.xml` file.

**Firewall**: Ensure that Tomcat is protected by a firewall, and unnecessary ports are closed.

**Authentication and Authorization: **Tomcat supports role-based access control, where users must authenticate and be assigned roles to access certain parts of the application. This can be done via basic authentication

**VIII) TOMCAT PERFORMANCE:**

**Thread Pooling: **Tomcat uses thread pools to handle concurrent requests that can be configured in Server.xml.

**Connection Pooling: **Tomcat supports connection pooling (e.g., for database connections) to reduce the overhead of repeatedly opening and closing connections.

**Caching: **Tomcat can cache static resources, improving response times for frequently requested resources.

**iX) DEPLOYMENT IN TOMCAT:**



* Copy the WAR file to the `webapps` directory. Tomcat will automatically unpack the WAR file and deploy the application.
* Maven or Gradle plugins: You can use plugins in build tools like Maven or Gradle to automate the deployment process.

**X) PROBLEMS SOLVED BY TOMCAT:**

Provides a runtime environment for Java Servlets and JSPs, 

Simplifies deployment of web applications through WAR files 

Manages HTTP requests and responses with a multithreaded architecture even with high traffic.

Secures web applications by providing authentication, access control, and SSL/TLS support.
